      "head": "Rolex is a British-founded Swiss watch designer and manufacturer based in Geneva, Switzerland. Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for wristwatch); it later became Rolex SA. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.",

              "information": "The history of Rolex is inextricably linked to the visionary spirit of Hans Wilsdorf, its founder. In 1905, at the age of 24, Hans Wilsdorf founded a company in London specialising in the distribution of timepieces. He began to dream of a watch worn on the wrist. Wristwatches were not very precise at the time, but Hans Wilsdorf foresaw that they could become not only elegant, but also reliable. To convince the public of the reliability of his resolutely innovative timepieces, he equipped them with small, very precise movements manufactured by a Swiss watchmaking company in Bienne."

He said, “I tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way. This gave me some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. One morning, while riding on the upper deck of a horse-drawn omnibus along Cheapside in the City of London, a genie whispered ‘Rolex’ in my ear.”"

Audemars created complicated watch movements for different manufacturers to then finish and fit into their own cases. Piguet performed the final regulation. After they started working together in 1875, they continued this split function in different ways. Audemars oversaw the production and technical aspects of the watches while Piguet focused his time on sales and management. The name Audemars Piguet & Cie was first used in 1881. In 1892, the brand created the first-minute repeater wristwatch. By 1899 the first Grand Complication pocket watch was released by the pair, featuring a minute repeater, alarm, perpetual calendar, deadbeat seconds, chronograph, and split-seconds hand."

Continuing through to today, the brand was continued on by the next generation of Audemars and Piguet, this time sons Paul Louis Audemars and Paul Edward Piguet. During the early-mid 1900s, the manufacturer continued to push for innovation within the watch community. The thinnest pocket watch caliber was released by the brand in 1925, while the first skeletonized pocket watch was released in 1934. In 1946, the brand launched the world’s thinnest wristwatch. The first Audemars Piguet perpetual calendar wristwatch was released in 1957. The brand also holds the record for the first thinnest self-winding automatic caliber featuring a central rotor that had a thickness of 2.45mm, released in 1967."

With additions to existing luxury watches, like adding split-seconds to its Triple Complication and brand new innovations, the 1990s proved to be a creative decade that also set the stage for present-day masterpieces. Audemars Piguet began the decade by releasing the Star Wheel Wandering Hours ref. 25720, a truly unique timepiece even for a watchmaker known for original designs. With a nod to 17th-century wandering hour complications, this wristwatch features spinning discs mounted on star-shaped wheels. A beautiful example of ingenuity, the Star Wheel is far removed from Audemars Piguet’s signature Royal Oak, but it is regarded as a horological innovation."

With the help of clever marketing strategies and unusual concepts, Hublot became the 'Rising Star' among Swiss watchmakers.
