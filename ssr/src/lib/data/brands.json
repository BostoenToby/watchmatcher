Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for wristwatch); it later became Rolex SA.

Wristwatches were not very precise at the time, but Hans Wilsdorf foresaw that they could become not only elegant, but also reliable. To convince the public of the reliability of his resolutely innovative timepieces, he equipped them with small, very precise movements manufactured by a Swiss watchmaking company in Bienne."

      "head": "The luxury watch brand Hublot (French for 'bullseye') based in Nyon, Switzerland was founded in 1980 by the Italian Carlo Crocco. The company founder was able to combine Italian design with Swiss craftsmanship and produce unconventional products. Even if the success did not start immediately, the company's history has become a success story. With the help of clever marketing strategies and unusual concepts, Hublot became the 'Rising Star' among Swiss watchmakers. When Hublot was sold to LVMH in 2008, sales were estimated at 200 million Swiss francs.",
