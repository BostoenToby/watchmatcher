While the arrival of wristwatches makes the tourbillon's role less clear, its creation requires greater expertise. Whatever the position of the watch, it is vital to achieve absolute precision in the rotating escapement."

        "text": "Circular perfection, a quest for essentials: the Patrimony collection is the epitome of stylistic pureness. Reflecting a deliberately minimalist approach striking a beautiful balance between taut lines and curves, it asserts its personality through slender cases radiating an elegance inspired by 1950s Vacheron Constantin models."
